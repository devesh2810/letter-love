I will be forever grateful to you for everything you have done for me. It all started with that little Jumpscare. </p> <p> I wouldn't have dared to approach you if you hadn't been the one talking to me. Things happened and I fell in love with you. </p> <p> I was afraid what would happen if she were to like someone else?? Am I good for her?? She's so pretty mere sath kahan acchi lgegi and it all led to our fights. I'm sorry for that. Then one day I just knew, I love you and you love me so much. </p> <p> My heart settled. It felt at peace üïäÔ∏è I found my other half my meaning of life my lover. Every date every day with you was everything I could hope for. </p> <p> It was happening so fast, it all felt like a dream that the fear of losing you started to hover over my head. You didn't care about yourself. I don't want any bad thing for you. I wish I could be more calm headed during those fights. I'm really sorry for shouting and I'm really thankful for tolerating me till now. I mean it. </p> <p> I don't like birthdays, I feel like disappearing on that day. There was nothing for me to be excited about everything every excitement every overacting was a facade. Deep down I don't want anyone to remember it's my birthday. That's what happened on that day too. I was sleepy but more than that I was afraid of facing you facing others. I don't really felt special until I saw your story. There was me. There was you. There was us. </p> <p> I felt so warm ki koi mer liye mujhse zyda excited h. </p> <p> Mujhe audio ka yaad tha ma kasam m bus m tha I saw the clips but I didn't have lead I thought baadmai sununga akele mai tabh tum aaye pura din saath guzara ush din yaad karo phone m battery bhi nhi thi ghar phoncte phonchte 2 percent battery thi pure raaste phone bhi nhi chalaya kyunki recharge nhi tha phone m aur ticket bhi online thi kyunki bheerh hoti h 52 sector pe phir itna sabh hua celebration tumse baat videocall pe among all those things I forgot to listen to them. </p> <p> Meri galti h I'm sorry I don't want to end things. </p> <p> Why do u even think mujhe tumse door Jana h??
